Snow Beta Build

-> Info: 
Created by zyze74,
Current Update: v0.31

-> Not Working? 
Please remember to disable real time protection before downloading this application.
This is not because it is a virus, it just detects the code as malicious as it is 
not recognised by Windows. 

-> Think its a virus? 
I'm currently working on a workaround to make this code open-source without leaking 
sensitive information, but I can personally assure you its not a virus.

-> Updates: 
Next update v0.32 soon..
